# HELPOUT - Providing tools for Humanitarian Assistance

### Welcome to the _**helpout project**_ platform!
***
**Brief disclaimer:**
- This tool is a practice project that covers two passions:
  - Coding with Python (Django)
  - Using technology to solve real-life problems
<p>
I started this project to learn new technologies, improve coding skills in Python (more
specifically with Django), HTML, CSS and - maybe - some JavaScript. The focus here is to
demonstrate the power of Django as a fullstack framework, while learning about it
and starting my first open-source project that focuses on building a tool to assist teams
to respond to humanitarian crisis.
